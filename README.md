# rfap - Reliable File Access Protocol

This project is in a very early stage. We are still in the planning phase, so
radical changes are to come.

This repository contains documentation, specifications, overviews and
organizational information about the protocol. See
[related projects](#related-projects-in-progress) for actual implementations.

## Why did we start this project?

FTP is too old.

NFS is unencrypted.

SMB is too complex.

WebDAV makes not much sense.

SSHFS is for nerds.

*So what is the best way to share files?*
