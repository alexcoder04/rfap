First of all, we really appreciate your interest in our project ðŸ˜€!

This project is started and maintained by
[@alexcoder04](https://github.com/alexcoder04) and
[@BoettcherDasOriginal](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal). We are not
professionals and we're happy about any kind of contributions. Please note that
this project is in an early stage, so our workflows are not optimized very well.
Here is a list of resources you could check out, depending on what you want to do:

## General protocol design

The specifications of the protocol are planned and discussed here, in this
repository. Simply open an [issue](https://github.com/alexcoder04/rfap/issues)
if you find something that could be improved, fixed or added.

## Implementations in different languages

You can also find this list in the [README](./README.md#related-projects-in-progress).

### Official

Your favourite language is not here and you want to add support for it? No
problem, we try to keep the protocol open and well-documented, so anyone can
build compatible applications. Please, open an issue in this repo and tell us
about your project, so we can add it to this list and follow its development.
Also don't hesitate to ask if something is documented unclearly.

## Testing / reporting bugs / feature requests / user experiences

If you've tested out one or multiple of the implementations and want report your
experiences, consider opening an issue in the respective project.
